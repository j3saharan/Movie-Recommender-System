**Movie Recommendation System**

This repository contains the code and data for a project that implements a movie recommendation system using Python libraries like Streamlit, NumPy, and Pandas.

**Project Overview:**

* **Goal:** Develop a web application that suggests movies based on user preferences.
* **Approach:**
    * Collaborative filtering or content-based filtering (or a combination of both)
    * Data-driven recommendations from the provided dataset
    * Streamlit for an interactive user interface
* **Libraries:**
    * Streamlit for building the web app
    * NumPy for numerical computations
    * Pandas for data manipulation

**Dataset:**

* Link to the dataset used is provided: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata]
* Description of the dataset (aprrox 5000 records)

**Code Files:**

* **Jupyter Notebook:** `jupyter_notebook.ipynb`
    * Contains data analysis, preprocessing, and model training (if applicable)
    * Provides insights into the exploration and development process
* **PyCharm Code:** `pycharm_code.py`
    * Main implementation of the movie recommender system logic
    * Integrates with Streamlit for the web interface
    * Clearly structured and commented for understanding

**Running the Project:**

1. **Dependencies:**
    * Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries 
2. **Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Download or clone the repository.
    * Open the `jupyter_notebook.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
    * Run the cells in order to explore the data and train the model (if applicable).
3. **PyCharm Code:**
    * Open the `pycharm_code.py` file in PyCharm IDE.
    * Run the Python script.
    * The Streamlit web app will launch in your browser.

**User Interface:**

* Description of the web app interface:
    * Input mechanisms for users to provide their preferences
    * Recommendation display 5 movie posters
